    <p class="flow-text">
      In the first half of 2018 alone, there have been
      <a href="https://blog.barkly.com/biggest-data-breaches-2018-so-far" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
        at least 10 major data breaches.
      </a>
      This is just a symptom of a larger problem. As I continue to ramble here, I
      will continue to make points indicating how companies are gathering
      increasing amounts of personal information. The increased amounts and
      specificity of the gathered information creates a lucrative target for
      hackers. Whether through shoddy security practices or the actions of a
      determined attacker, this data is finding its way into the hand of malicious
      actors with increasing frequency.

      We will provide resources to help people better understand the types of
      data being collected, what this data is used for, and ways they can
      protect themselves.
