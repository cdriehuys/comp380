We talk a lot about the risks of data collection, so what is driving companies
to do it in the first place? It turns out the primary driver behind obtaining as
much data as possible is to enhance analytics that improve profits. The most
reliable way to improve a statistical analysis is to provide more data, and
that's exactly what companies are doing. Whether it's tracking pixels to
determine which pages you visit or logging location data to correlate with
purchases, all tracking is done to more efficiently serve the most relevant
information to consumers.
