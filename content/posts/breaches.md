With all the data that companies gather about users, there is an enormous risk
of that data being compromised. Naturally, as the number of companies
collecting identifying information and the amount of users sending this
information over the web increase, the attack surface also grows. This has led
to a large number of data breaches and leaks over the years.

## Breach Timeline

Using data from [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com), we have
created a timeline of recorded data breaches. Note that the vast majority of
breaches affected tens of thousands, if not millions of accounts.

This is some text below the timeline to see how it is positioned.
