The federal government has been reluctant to pass any laws which truly protect
people's privacy. Despite the lack of federal law there are some states who have
taken matters into their own hands and created policies which at least let
users be aware of what they are giving up.

California, the leader in internet privacy laws, has passed a law that allows
consumers to not only request what a company is doing with their information,
but also opt out of a sale of the information or even ask for it to be deleted.
While it may seem like common sense to allow the general public to ask a company
to not disclose their personal information, this is an extremely rare right and
california is the only state to allow its citizens to browse the internet with
privacy.

There are only four states (California, Connecticut, Delaware, and Nevada) which
require companies to explicitly disclose their privacy policy in some way.
California requires that websites disclose what they change when you turn on the
do-not-track mode in browsers. Connecticut has a policy which protects users who
give websites their social security numbers. It forces these websites to have
explicit privacy policies which prevent them from sharing your social security
number. Delaware requires companies to post their privacy policies within thirty
days of coming online. Finally, Nevada requires that companies disclose how they
are going to use the information that they collect.

This almost complete lack of legal protection form peopleâ€™s privacy is what
allows companies to make so much money off of selling your personal information
to advertisers and others. We need more laws which protect our privacy so we are
not at the mercy of the corporations.
