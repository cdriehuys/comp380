## How can consumers protect themselves in our online world?

A website or service can do a great job in protecting breaches from their end, but in order to be as secure as possible there are some steps each user should take toward protecting their data. You wouldn't want someone else posting to your facebook page, or tweeting from your account, and you especially don't want someone going into your bank account.

First, you should make sure that you are using a "strong" password. When coming up with a password, you don't want it to be easily guessable. For example, you want to avoid using a pet's name or significant dates becuase these are fairly common.  Instead, you want a password comprised of numbers, letters (upper and lowercase) and special characters that is at least 8 characters. Following these steps will make your password more secure.

Second, utilize additional security measures when possible. This way, if someone does come across your password, then they wont be able access your accounts without multiple forms of verification. You become less of a target if accessing your account requires having your password and your phone for a 2-step verification.

* Multifactor authentication
    * Something you know (password)
    * Something you have (MFA token)
    * Something you are (Biometric)

Great job! You have a strong password protecting your account backed up by multifactor authentication. But you're not done yet! You now want to protect yourself from one breach leading to another. If you are using the same password for more than one of your accounts then if someone can get into one, then they can get into others! It is much easier to just remember one password than multiple ones, but this is definitely a precaution worth taking. This also makes it easier on you if one account gets hacked. Instead of having to go in and change all of your passwords, you only need to handle the one account. Make sure to use different passwords for each account. Specifically, stay away from using variations on other passwords, or reusing old passwords. You want each password for each account to be unique and strong.

## Dealing With Lots of Passwords

We've discussed how to create a strong password and to create different passwords for each account, but how is someone supposed to remember all of these non-trivial sequences of characters in their head? What password goes with which account?

One solution is to write them down on paper, and keep them in a secure place in your home (perhaps a lockbox). This is a pretty secure method of protecting your passwords, since you can't "hack" into a piece of paper without breaking into the house. Unfortunately, you are setting yourself up for a situation where you're away from the house and need to get into an account. Resetting your password in this instance is an inconvenience, and you don't want to reset the strong password you did such a great job creating. To solve this predicament, read further.

Use a secure password storing software. Now you only have to remember one secure password, for this account. You can place the security of your passwords on a software, whose job it is to keep your info safe. Since you're putting a heavy responsibility on this program you want to make sure they are trustworthy, so here are some app suggestions to help with that:
