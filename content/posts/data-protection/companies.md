## The Onus of the Companies

Companies may be storing multiple kinds of data about its users. There is the actual data (which is comprised of the user's name, email and other identifiers) and there is the user accounts (which should be password protected).

These websites should be protecting the user accounts. For example, a company that sells things should keep secure user accounts. You don't want people to easily hack into other user accounts and make purchases. This hurts the reputation of the company and people wont use that sales site, if it is unsecure.

Having secure accounts is probably the top priority for companies data security, but there is also the matter of keeping their data secure, Or is there? For example, if someone provides their information to a company (Name, address, phone number, email, etc) then you should expect this information to be kept private from the world. It is important to know the policies of companies you give information to. While not everyone reads the 'Terms and Conditions', it may be smart to check how they are storing your data. It could be a security risk and lead to identity theft if someone has all of this information. At the very least, it is annoying to get spam mail, phone calls and emails.

As a user it is important to know where your data is. Is the data at a company that is willing to sell its customer information to make a buck? Or is their security infrastructure weak enough where a hacker can get it regardless? In 2011, PlayStation was hacked and 77 million users' payment information was stolen [^playstation].These things are important to consider when you are making an account on a website, or clicking "I accept terms and agreements". As a consumer, you should make sure your priorities align with the comapny you are intrusting to protect your data. A study found possible discrepancies usually exist between company and user privacy priorities[^discrepancies].

## When a Breach Happens, Here is How Companies Should Handle it

First, companies need to make it easy to report breaches. It is important to find and identify breaches quickly, to handle them and prevent further leaks. Perhaps people will identify a weakness in security before it becomes a big issue. Companies that ignore warnings often end up getting breached later.

While you want to identify the breach as urgently as possible, you also want to work to fix it with the same pace. If a waterbottle is spilling on the table you don't just watch it, you pick it up to prevent all the water from spilling out.

The next priority is to disclose the breach. This is important for a couple of reasons. Concerning the users, they need to be told of the breach so they can take precautions to protect their data. In the instance of the PlayStation scandal, users with breached data would have wanted to cancel their credit cards [^playstation].

From a perspective of PR for the company, they would want to disclose their breach instead of a news source. It is better to get ahead of it and take responsibility for the lack of security.

As the company continues to work with urgency to patch the breach, they should continue to keep the user base up-to-date. When disclosing information they need to be very clear. There should be no ambiguity as to what to company means. Users should know what type of data has been breached, how big it was and be reassured the company is working hard to fix it [^how-to-succeed].
