title: Data Protection by Companies
description: >
  As the party collecting data, companies have a responsibility to secure that
  data to the best of their ability. A large number of breaches have been
  caused by publicly exposing servers with sensitive data or not taking
  security threats seriously.

* Follow best practices for security
    * Do not leave publicly exposed systems
    * Security is often an afterthought rather than a core requirement
* Create channel for disclosing security breaches
    * Companies who ignore warnings are often breached later
