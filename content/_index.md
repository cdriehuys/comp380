In 2017, [over 170 million people had their data breached][data-breaches-2017],
and inn the first half of 2018 alone, there have been
[at least 10 major data breaches][data-breaches-2018]. Our lifestyle is becoming
increasingly dependent on digital communications, communications that often
contain personally identifying information. As data gets sent and collected on
larger and larger scales, the potential for data breaches also rises.

While the companies that collect users' data hold the primary responsibility for
securing that data, there are also steps that users can take to ensure that they
minimize the fallout of a single breach. The goal of this website is to educate
those who collect the data on best practices, and to inform consumers on the
internet on how they can stay safe.
