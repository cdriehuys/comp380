## Data Security in a Digital Culture

In the first half of 2018 alone, there have been
[at least 10 major data breaches][data-breaches]. This is just a symptom of a 
larger problem. As I continue to ramble here, I will continue to make points
indicating how companies are gathering increasing amounts of personal
information. The increased amounts and specificity of the gathered information
creates a lucrative target for hackers. Whether through shoddy security 
practices or the actions of a determined attacker, this data is finding its way 
into the hand of malicious actors with increasing frequency.

We will provide resources to help people better understand the types of data 
being collected, what this data is used for, and ways they can protect
themselves.
